#Introduction
This is a web based service to verify that an individual is a nerd and allow them access to specialized content.  It was inspired by me and a friend's plan to create a true nerd table at lunch, where members must pass this test
#Building
Clone the repository, and be sure to install <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>.  Then, open a terminal in the root directory and first run "npm install".  This should install all dependencies (as defined in package.json) and from there you should be able to run "node app.js" which will launch the server on the port specified within app.js
